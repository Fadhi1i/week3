Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?
TensorFlow was developed by Google and emphasizes production, deployment, scalability, and compatibility with tools like TensorFlow Lite.
Uses static computation graphs.

PyTorch, developed by Meta, uses dynamic computation graphs, making it more flexible and intuitive for research & experimentation.

PyTorch → research, experimentation, and flexibility
TensorFlow → large-scale deployment

Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.
a) Model prototyping and experimentation – They allow data scientists to write and test small pieces of code interactively, visualize results immediately, and iterate quickly on model design.

b) Teaching, documentation, and sharing research –
Jupyter notebooks support Markdown, code, and visual outputs in one file, making them ideal for tutorials, project documentation, and collaborative research where results and explanations are combined.

Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

It provides linguistically informed, high-performance NLP tools that go far beyond Python’s basic string handling.

Unlike plain string methods (like .split()), spaCy performs tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and lemmatization using pretrained language models.

Provides deeper understanding of text structure and meaning, which is essential for tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and information extraction.
